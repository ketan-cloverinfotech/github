Thought about developer code management and SSH for 4 seconds

Below is a suggested outline and content for a developer training session covering the topics you listed. Each section explains the essential Git concepts and steps to practice. You can use this structure to deliver a workshop or create hands-on exercises.

* * *

1\. How to change code and check status of your changed code
------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Topics

1.  **What is Git**
    
    *   Brief introduction to Git as a distributed version control system (VCS).
    *   Importance of tracking changes and collaborating on code.
2.  **Basic Git Workflow**
    
    *   **`git clone`**: How to clone a repository from a remote.
    *   **Making changes**: Editing files, creating new files, etc.
    *   **`git status`**: Checking which files have changed or are untracked.
    *   **`git diff`**: Comparing changes with the last commit or between commits.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone <remote-repo-url>

# Check the status of your changes
git status

# See the diff of what you've changed
git diff

# Stage your changes
git add <file-name>     # or "git add ." for all changed files

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

### Practical Exercise Suggestions

*   **Exercise #1**: Have developers clone a sample project, modify a file (e.g., add a new function or comment), then run `git status` and `git diff` to see the changes before committing.

* * *

2\. How to push changed code to a remote repository
---------------------------------------------------

### Key Topics

1.  **Local vs. Remote**
    
    *   Explaining local repositories vs. remote repositories.
    *   Importance of synchronizing changes so everyone can see them.
2.  **Push Workflow**
    
    *   **`git push`**: Sending local commits to the remote repository.
    *   **`git pull`**: Fetching and merging remote changes into the local branch.
3.  **Branching Basics**
    
    *   Often, changes are done in separate feature branches, and then merged to the main branch.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Push your local changes to the remote
git push origin <branch-name>

# Pull the latest changes from the remote
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### Practical Exercise Suggestions

*   **Exercise #2**: Have developers commit their changes locally, then push them to the remote repository on a test branch. Afterwards, they should pull the latest changes to verify everything is synchronized.

* * *

3\. How to work with multiple developers when many developers can push their changed code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Topics

1.  **Working with Branches**
    
    *   Creating feature branches for separate tasks or features.
    *   Keeping the main (or `master`) branch stable.
2.  **Merging and Pull Requests**
    
    *   **`git merge`**: Combining changes from one branch into another.
    *   **Pull Requests (PR)**: A popular collaboration workflow. Developers create PRs for peer review before merging their changes into the main branch.
3.  **Resolving Merge Conflicts**
    
    *   Why merge conflicts happen.
    *   How to fix them manually in a file.
    *   Committing the resolved changes.
4.  **Best Practices**
    
    *   Keep your branch up-to-date by pulling or merging from the main branch frequently.
    *   Use meaningful commit messages.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Create a new branch for your work
git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>

# Merge another branch into your current branch
git merge <other-branch>

# When you have conflicts, fix them, then finalize the merge
git add <resolved-file>
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts"
```

### Practical Exercise Suggestions

*   **Exercise #3**: Create a scenario where two developers edit the same file (e.g., a README or a function in the same file). Have them push changes in separate branches, then walk through how to merge and resolve conflicts in one of the branches.

* * *

4\. SSH-based authentication with a custom SSH key
--------------------------------------------------

### Key Topics

1.  **Why SSH Keys**
    
    *   More secure and convenient than password-based authentication.
    *   One key pair can be used for multiple repositories or services (with caution).
2.  **Generating and Using SSH Keys**
    
    *   **`ssh-keygen`** command to generate a key.
    *   Typical folder paths (e.g., `~/.ssh/`).
    *   Adding the public key to your Git service (GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, etc.).
3.  **Setting up Git to use your SSH key**
    
    *   Ensuring the correct SSH URL is used when cloning/pushing (`git@github.com:...` or `git@your-azure-repo:...`).
    *   Testing your connection with `ssh -T git@github.com` or similar commands.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key pair in ~/.ssh directory
# e.g. for Azure, as you mentioned:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/azure

# Once generated, you will have two files:
# 1) Private key: ~/.ssh/azure
# 2) Public key:  ~/.ssh/azure.pub

# Add your public key to the remote Git service’s SSH settings.
# Then verify your SSH connection:
ssh -T git@github.com
# or for Azure:
ssh -T git@ssh.dev.azure.com
```

### Practical Exercise Suggestions

*   **Exercise #4**: Have each developer generate their own SSH key pair, add the public key to the remote Git provider, then clone/push code via SSH (not HTTPS) to confirm everything is set up correctly.

* * *

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

### Recommended Training Flow

1.  **Introduction to Git**: 10–15 minutes
    
    *   Why we use version control, basic terminology.
2.  **Local Changes & Status**: 15–20 minutes
    
    *   Demonstrate a simple edit–status–diff–commit workflow.
3.  **Push and Pull**: 15–20 minutes
    
    *   Show how to sync changes with the remote repository.
4.  **Collaboration**: 20–30 minutes
    
    *   Branching strategy, merging, pull requests, and conflict resolution.
5.  **SSH Authentication**: 15–20 minutes
    
    *   Generate SSH keys, configure them in the platform, clone/push code over SSH.
6.  **Hands-On Exercises**: 30–45 minutes
    
    *   Have the team practice each step.

### Additional Tips

*   **Use Realistic Examples**: Let developers work on a real (or realistic) project so that they understand the Git commands in context.
*   **Encourage Best Practices**:
    *   Small, frequent commits with descriptive messages.
    *   Pull frequently to minimize merge conflicts.
    *   Use feature branches for isolated development.
    *   Review code through pull/merge requests.
*   **Troubleshooting**:
    *   Show them how to revert a commit (`git revert`) or reset branches (`git reset`) if something goes wrong.
    *   Teach them how to read and fix common error messages (e.g., “rejected because remote contains work that you do not have locally”).

* * *

### Conclusion

By following this training outline, developers will learn the essential Git commands for modifying code, collaborating with others, and securely managing their repositories via SSH. Encourage hands-on practice at every step so that they build familiarity and confidence.
