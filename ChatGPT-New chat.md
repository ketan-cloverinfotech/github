Thought about GitHub training topics for 6 seconds

Below is a suggested outline with talking points, instructions, and some best practices for each of the topics you mentioned. You can use this as a guide when conducting your training session.

* * *

1\. Show Your Organization and Number of Repositories
-----------------------------------------------------

1.  **Accessing GitHub Organization**
    *   Navigate to your organization’s GitHub page (e.g., `https://github.com/<your_organization>`).
    *   Highlight the total number of repositories within the organization.
2.  **Structure and Visibility**
    *   Demonstrate how repositories might be categorized (public, private, archived).
    *   Mention the role of teams and permissions if relevant.

> **Tip**: Emphasize the importance of properly organizing repositories and ensuring teams have the correct access.

* * *

2\. How to Clone a Repository Locally
-------------------------------------

1.  **Find the Repository to Clone**
    
    *   Open the repository page on GitHub.
    *   Click the green “Code” button.
2.  **Copy the Repository URL**
    
    *   For HTTPS: Copy the URL starting with `https://...`
    *   For SSH: Copy the URL starting with `git@...` (requires setting up SSH keys).
3.  **Use Git Bash (or Terminal) to Clone**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-URL>
    ```
    
    *   This will create a local folder with the repository content.
4.  **Verify the Clone**
    
    *   Navigate into the newly created folder to view the code locally.

> **Tip**: Discuss the difference between cloning via HTTPS vs. SSH (authentication and convenience).

* * *

3\. What is Git and Git Bash? (Differences)
-------------------------------------------

1.  **Git**
    
    *   A distributed version control system.
    *   Tracks changes in source code and helps collaborate on projects.
    *   Manages history of every file’s changes through commits.
2.  **Git Bash**
    
    *   A _terminal application_ for Windows, providing a Bash emulation.
    *   Allows running Git commands (and other Unix-like commands) on Windows.
    *   On macOS or Linux, the standard terminal already supports Git commands.
3.  **Difference**
    
    *   _Git_ is the underlying tool (version control system).
    *   _Git Bash_ is one way (on Windows) to interact with Git from the command line.

> **Tip**: Also mention alternative ways to interact with Git (e.g., using GUI clients like GitHub Desktop or VS Code’s built-in Git tools).

* * *

4\. How to Change Code Locally and Check Changed Code
-----------------------------------------------------

1.  **Navigate to the Local Repository**
    
    *   Open the project folder on your computer or in your IDE.
2.  **Create or Edit Files**
    
    *   Make changes to your code or add new files.
3.  **Check Changes**
    
    *   In your terminal or Git Bash, run:
        
        ```bash
        git status
        ```
        
    *   This shows which files have been modified or added.
4.  **Stage and Commit Changes**
    
    *   Stage files (add them to the “to-be-committed” list):
        
        ```bash
        git add <filename> 
        ```
        
        or to add all changed files:
        
        ```bash
        git add .
        ```
        
    *   Commit changes with a message describing what was done:
        
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Your commit message"
        ```
        
5.  **View Your Commit History**
    
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    

> **Tip**: Encourage writing clear and concise commit messages that help others understand what changed.

* * *

5\. How to Push Changed Code to GitHub
--------------------------------------

1.  **Check Remote**
    
    *   Ensure your repository has a remote set (usually `origin`):
        
        ```bash
        git remote -v
        ```
        
2.  **Push Your Changes**
    
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
    
    *   If you’re working on the main branch, it may just be `main` or `master`.
    *   If you’re on a feature branch, push to that specific branch.
3.  **Authentication**
    
    *   For HTTPS, you’ll be prompted for your username and personal access token/password.
    *   For SSH, you won’t be prompted if you have properly set up your SSH keys.

> **Tip**: Always pull the latest changes from the remote before pushing to avoid merge conflicts:

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

* * *

6\. How to Revert and Reset Changes
-----------------------------------

1.  **Undo Local Changes (Not Committed Yet)**
    
    *   If you want to discard changes in a specific file (pre-commit):
        
        ```bash
        git checkout -- <file>
        ```
        
    *   This reverts the file to the last committed state.
2.  **Reset a Commit**
    
    *   **Soft reset** (keeps changes in working directory):
        
        ```bash
        git reset --soft HEAD~1
        ```
        
    *   **Mixed reset** (default; uncommits and un-stages):
        
        ```bash
        git reset HEAD~1
        ```
        
    *   **Hard reset** (dangerous; discards commits and changes permanently):
        
        ```bash
        git reset --hard HEAD~1
        ```
        
3.  **Revert a Commit (Creates a New Commit)**
    
    ```bash
    git revert <commit-hash>
    ```
    
    *   Safest option for shared or public branches because it preserves commit history.

> **Tip**: Emphasize that _revert_ is safer for published commits, while _reset_ is more common for local or private branches.

* * *

7\. How to Raise a Pull Request (PR) from Feature Branch to Main or UAT Branch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Create/Checkout a Feature Branch**
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
    ```
    
    *   Make changes, commit, and push to GitHub:
        
        ```bash
        git push origin feature/awesome-feature
        ```
        
2.  **Open a Pull Request on GitHub**
    
    *   Go to the repository on GitHub.
    *   If prompted, click **Compare & pull request** or click **New pull request**.
    *   Ensure the _base_ branch is `main` or `UAT` (whichever you’re merging into).
    *   Ensure the _compare_ branch is your feature branch.
3.  **Add Title and Description**
    
    *   Write a clear title (e.g., “Adds new feature X”).
    *   Add description, references to issues, or relevant details.
4.  **Submit Pull Request**
    
    *   Click **Create pull request**.
    *   This notifies maintainers or reviewers that a PR is ready for review.

> **Tip**: Encourage linking any relevant Jira tickets or GitHub issues in the PR description for easier cross-referencing.

* * *

8\. How to Create a Branch Locally with a Specific Name
-------------------------------------------------------

1.  **Branch Naming Convention**
    
    *   Discuss a consistent naming format, e.g.,
        *   `feature/<short-description>`
        *   `bugfix/<short-description>`
        *   `hotfix/<short-description>`
2.  **Create and Switch to the New Branch**
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
    ```
